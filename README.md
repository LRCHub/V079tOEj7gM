# Tones And I – Fly Away

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew
I couldn’t stay
So I had a dream that
I'd just fly away
I've been on my own for a minute
Is it only me all day?
Searching for the place
to begin it
Is it me? Is it you? Is it fear?
Standing on the line I was given
People stare and ask me
Why I'm here
No one seems to think
that I fit in
But I don't wanna be like them
No, 'cause I don't wanna be
like them
'Cause I know that
I, know that I
I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew
I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just
fly away, away, oh
(Fly away, fly away)
Woah, woah, I'd fly away
No one knew how low
I was feeling
I was scared to reach for it all
Knowing I was here for a reason
But I was scarеd that
if I tried, I'd fall
So where do I go now
that I'm in it?
I nеver thought
it'd be like this
Dreaming all my life
And I did it
Thought the grass is greener
than it is
'Cause I had a dream
that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew
I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just
fly away, away, oh
Woah, oh (Fly away, fly away)
Oh, I'd fly away, woah, woah, oh
(Fly away, fly away)
I'd fly away
'Cause I had a dream
that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew
I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just
fly away, away, oh
Woah, woah
(Fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away)
Woah, woah, woah
(Fly away, fly away
Fly away)
I'd fly away
